# Soil_moisture_detection
In this project, I developed a soil moisture estimation model using the Decision Tree Regressor. By harnessing the power of machine learning, I successfully predicted soil moisture content with accuracy and efficiency. This experience further honed my skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, and model optimization.
# Accuracy score
The accuracy score of the model on the test data is 0.9994.
